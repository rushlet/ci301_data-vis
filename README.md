## Development

Run `npm install` to setup.

Run `gulp` to build. (If you get '`gulp: command not found`' then you may need to run `npm install --global gulp-cli`)

Use `npm install -g live-server` and run `live-server` for real time JS update

To run tests, run `npm run cucumber` in the terminal (currently not set up)
