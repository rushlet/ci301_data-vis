          This data visualisation project highlights the most successful songs in UK chart history.<br />
          It considers how certain attributes of songs have changed over time and showcases some of
          the most surprising songs to have made music history.

          The UK Music Charts began on
          <strong>14th November 1952</strong>

          Out of these, 2 are held by children's cartoon character Bob the Builder. <br />
          The same number as Grammy award-winning Adele.

          Similarly, music legends Jimi Hendrix and Prince both only hold one number 1 each - the same number as the Teletubbies.

          Let's take a closer look at the artists who have topped the charts.

              This graph shows the distribution of artists who have lasted the longest at number 1.
              The size of each bubble represents the number of tracks that have contributed to the length of time.

              <span class="artist-name">Elvis</span> is the King of the Charts, with 18 UK number 1s.
              <span class="artist-name">The Beatles</span> just miss out, with 17.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unsurprisingly, <span class="artist-name">Elvis</span> and <span class="artist-name">The Beatles</span> have also spent the longest time at
              number 1, with 79 and 69 weeks respectively.

            <p>
              Other successful artists, in terms of most number 1s, include <span class="artist-name">Cliff Richard</span> (14), <span class="artist-name">Westlife</span> (14) and <span class="artist-name">Madonna</span> (13).

            <p>
              <span class="artist-name">Frankie Laine</span> has held the number 1 position for 32 weeks - the 5th longest serving artist.
              He did this with only 4 songs reaching number 1.
            </p>
            <p>
              This could be because they were in 1953, when the charts were
              just beginning so there may have been less competition.

            <p>
              However, <span class="artist-name">Wet Wet Wet</span> have also held the position for a substantial amount of time
              (23 weeks) with only 3 tracks, thanks to the success of ‘Love is all Around’ in 1994.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span class="artist-name">Justin Bieber</span> has spent the same amount of time at the top of the charts as <span class="artist-name">Madonna</span> and <span class="artist-name">Take That</span>,
              despite having half the number of songs reach number 1.
              They have each held the position for 29 weeks, with 6, 13 and 12 songs respectively.
