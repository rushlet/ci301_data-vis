          Let's look a little deeper into the audio features of number 1 songs.
        </h2>
      </div>
      <div class="section-tracks__slide">
        <p>
          Spotify attaches a variety of attributes to each of the songs in their
          library. Described as ‘audio features’, these include danceability,
          valence (‘feel goodness’), energy, acousticness and loudness.
        </p>
        <p>
          The attributes are generated by EchoNest, who employ a range of
          techniques to quantify them. For example, danceability is
          calculated by considering overall tempo and beat strength, whereas
          valence used the opinion of a musical expert which was then
          expanded upon using machine learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following analysis is based on the values provided by Spotify for the songs which have reached number 1.
          5 songs have been ommited as they are not available on Spotify.
