          This data visualisation project highlights the most successful songs in UK chart history.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using data from <a href="http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/all-the-number-1-singles__7931/">the Official Charts</a> and <a href="http://www.spotify.com/">Spotify</a>, it considers how certain attributes of songs have changed over time and showcases some of
          the most surprising songs to have made music history.

          The UK Music Charts began on

        </h2>
        <h2>
          In the <strong>3398 weeks</strong> between then and the 1st of January 2018, <strong>1325</strong> different songs have reached number 1

        <p>
          Of these, only 2 are held by Adele - the same number as children's cartoon character Bob the Builder.</p>

          Bob topped the charts with his signature song ‘Can We Fix It?’ for
          Christmas in 2000 and followed it up with ‘Mambo No. 5’ in 2001. Despite
          her album ’21’ going platinum, Grammy award winning super star Adele
          has also only had two singles reach number 1 in the UK charts - ‘Someone
          Like You’ (2011) and ‘Hello’ (2015).

        <p>
          Music legends Jimi Hendrix and Prince both only hold one number 1 each - and so do the Teletubbies.

          Surprisingly, Prince's only number 1 is 'The Most Beautiful Girl in the World'. 'Purple Rain', perhaps his most well known song, peaked at number 6. <br />
          Jimi Hendrix reached number 1 for just 1 week with 'Voodoo Chile' in 1970, whereas the Teletubbies were the 1997 Christmas number 1 with 'Teletubbies say Eh-Oh!', spending two weeks at the top spot.

          The songs which have lasted longest at number 1 are
          <span class="playable-track" data-id="049uxirFkHOefJ0yqPW8Kk">I Believe</span> by Frankie Laine, which has spent a total of 18 weeks at number 1.
          This is closely followed by
          <span class="playable-track" data-id="76qB2ZEZlEJAMqMqUjKusp">(Everything I Do) I Do It For You</span> by Bryan Adams (16 weeks)
          and <span class="playable-track" data-id="0A1Y3N4dwrTnjPLiuIMeDk">Love is All Around</span> by Wet Wet Wet (15 weeks).
        </p>
        <p>
          Although 'I Believe' was there for longer in total, it was knocked off twice (for only a week each time) before regaining the top spot.<br />
          '(Everything I Do) I Do It For You' holds the record for longest <em>consecutive</em> time at number 1. Bryan Adams spent an uninterrupted 16 weeks at number 1 - approximately 4 months!
          Wet Wet Wet were on course to beat Adams' record with 'Love is all Around' but halted production of the track before it could do so. In a 2015 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jul/14/how-we-made-love-is-all-around-wet-wet-wet-marti-pellow-graeme-clark">interview with The Guardian</a>, they said this was because <em>'It was just time to put the song to bed'</em>.

          A number of tracks have lasted a substantially long time in the top spot, but were interrupted by other songs before regaining their positions.
          For example <span class="playable-track" data-id="1AhDOtG9vPSOmsWgNW0BEY">Bohemian Rhapsody</span> and <span class="playable-track" data-id="7qiZfU4dY1lWllzX7mPBI3">Shape of You</span> have both spent a total of 14 weeks at number 1, non-consecutively.
        </p> -->
        <p>
          A few songs strongly defended their position at the top of the charts - they may have been knocked off, but they
          regained the top spot multiple times. Five songs got to number 1 three times, 'I Believe' was one of them, but there was also Pharrell Williams’
          <span class="playable-track" data-id="6NPVjNh8Jhru9xOmyQigds">Happy</span> and
          Justin Bieber’s <span class="playable-track" data-id="3pzjHKrQSvXGHQ98dx18HI">What Do You Mean?</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A couple of songs managed to reclaim the number 1 positions decades after they first conquered the charts.
          This includes <span class="playable-track" data-id="1chu8wc9zbNqTQ2ahROys1">My Sweet Lord</span>, by George Harrison, and
          Queen’s <span class="playable-track" data-id="1AhDOtG9vPSOmsWgNW0BEY">Bohemian Rhapsody</span>.
          The re-entries happened soon after both singers died, which is likely what caused the resurgence in the songs' popularity.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few of Elvis’s most famous singles were rereleased in 2005 to mark his 70th birthday.
          Some of these (including <span class="playable-track" data-id="4gphxUgq0JSFv2BCLhNDiE">Jailhouse Rock</span> and <span class="playable-track" data-id="1XunTmhOcj3xwh4b8P3isX">It's Now or Never</span>) reached number 1 again, over 45 years after they had first topped the charts.

          Audio Features
        </h2>
        <p>
          Spotify attaches a variety of attributes to each of the songs in their
          library. Described as ‘audio features’, these include danceability,
          valence (‘feel goodness’), energy, acousticness and loudness.
        </p>
        <p>
          The attributes are generated by EchoNest, who employ a range of
          techniques to quantify them. For example, danceability is
          calculated by considering overall tempo and beat strength, whereas
          valence used the opinion of a musical expert which was then
          expanded upon using machine learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following analysis is based on the values provided by Spotify for the songs which have reached number 1.

          Spotify <a href="https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/">describes</a> danceability as 'how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.'
        </p>
        <p>
          The most danceable songs that have reached number 1 are <span class="playable-track" data-id="3XVozq1aeqsJwpXrEZrDJ9">Ice Ice Baby</span> by Vanilla Ice and <span class="playable-track" data-id="2KjpWqvSKoQh0XIAywplWn">Give It To Me</span> by

        <h3>Valence</h3>

          Spotify describes valence as the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. 'Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry)'.
        </p>

              It then spiked in 2015 with more acoustic tracks taking the scene, thanks to artists such as
              Sam Smith and Justin Bieber.

            <h4>Danceability</h4>
            <p>
              Danceability has generally been increasing over the years.

          <div class='step' data-step='line-chart--danceability-high'>
            <p>
              It peaked in 1983, with some danceable classics -
              including Michael Jackson's <span class="playable-track" data-id="5ChkMS8OtdzJeqyybCc9R5">Billie Jean</span>,
               <span class="playable-track" data-id="7sm3orGGwNFqmWFSPRl8eT">Give It Up</span> by KC & The Sunshine Band
              and <span class="playable-track" data-id="3sFEGvMPkY8Ti97K94Pwp9">Red Red Wine</span> By Ub40.

            <p>
              Danceability plummeted in 1967, the year when songs including Nancy and Frank Sinatra's
              <span class="playable-track" data-id="3cVWNLd0uEHkc2tnBoE3Ay">Somethin' Stupid</span>
              and The Beatles' <span class="playable-track" data-id="3xMSaDC9TU6AQJIsxQB7MK">All You Need Is Love</span> made it big.

            <h4>Valence</h4>
            <p>
              There is less of an obvious trend for valence than other audio features, but it seems to have generally declined since the 60s.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class='step' data-step='line-chart--valence-high'>
            <p>
              It reached its highest
              in 1963, with songs such as <span class="playable-track" data-id="2Q2Gu7Bv8iLenuygtBgDUw">From Me To You</span>, by The Beatles.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most number 1s had high valence scores this year. Even the lowest scoring ones quite happy - such as Cliff Richard’s <span class="playable-track" data-id="054qLeg034PXr1wM3DMstk">Summer Holiday</span>
              (which had the 3rd lowest valence score in 1963).

          </div>
          <div class='step' data-step='line-chart--valence-low-1954'>
            <p>
            On average, the least feel good year was 1954, featuring songs such as
            <span class="playable-track" data-id="2YqfGrsn017nC17cx84Onq">Secret Love</span> by Doris Day.
          </p>

          <div class='step' data-step='line-chart--valence-low-1996'>
            <p>
              The least feel good year since 1954 is 1996. <br />
              Curiously, both of these were the years before the current Conservative prime minister was replaced. <br />
              (Churchill by Conservative candidate Eden in 1955 and Major by Labour's Tony Blair in 1997)
          </p>
          <p>
            1996 saw some major events, including the Dunblane Massacre, the IRA
            bombing in Manchester, Charles and Diana divorcing and Take That splitting up.
            </p>
            <p>
              Could it be that these events had an impact on the happiness of music produced that year?
