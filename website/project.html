          This data visualisation project highlights the most successful songs in UK chart history.
        </p>
        <p>
          It considers how certain attributes of songs have changed over time and showcases some of
          the most surprising songs to have made music history.

          Out of these, only 2 are held by Grammy award-winning singer Adele. <br />

        <p>
          Spotify attaches a variety of attributes to each of the songs in their
          library. Described as ‘audio features’, these include danceability,
          valence (‘feel goodness’), energy, acousticness and loudness.
        </p>
        <p>
          The attributes are generated by EchoNest, who employ a range of
          techniques to quantify them. For example, danceability is
          calculated by considering overall tempo and beat strength, whereas
          valence used the opinion of a musical expert which was then
          expanded upon using machine learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following analysis is based on the values provided by Spotify for the songs which have reached number 1.
          5 songs have been ommited as they are not available on Spotify.

      </div>
      <div class="section-tracks__slide">
        <p>
          The most danceable songs that have reached number 1 are <span class="playable-track" data-id="3XVozq1aeqsJwpXrEZrDJ9">Ice Ice Baby</span> by Vanilla Ice and <span class="playable-track" data-id="2KjpWqvSKoQh0XIAywplWn">Give It To Me</span> by
          Timberland, Nelly Furtado and Justin Timberlake.

        <p>
          Arguabley, Justin Timberlake is the most danceable artist, holding both the
          joint first most danceable number one and
          the second most danceable (<span class="playable-track" data-id="40VAYnnGBDLQVXD8D1ager">SexyBack</span>).

          Surprisingly, Eminem holds 3 of the top 10 - <span class="playable-track" data-id="7KccdUP4IslFXUNNseqBc7">The Real Slim Shady</span>, <span class="playable-track" data-id="2RzWl7MCWqwQbTkA3vwGUk">Just Lose It</span> and <span class="playable-track" data-id="3qKGvSu1inEZKwYQnMavNA">Smack That</span> (collaboration with Akon).
